# Branch and bound algorithm for mixed integer programming problem
The material is from Chapter 7 of the text book titled "Integer programming" [1].


## Divide and Conquer
The constriant set should be divided into multiple subsets. The upper and lower are maximized over all subsets.


## Implicit Enumeration
Only three types of conditions can be derived:
(1) Pruned by optimality
(2) Pruned by bound
(3) Pruned by infeasibility
(4) No pruning possible

## Branch and bound: an example
Solve a simple case
(1) Using a linear programming solver
