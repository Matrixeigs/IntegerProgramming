# IntegerProgramming
Integer programming code for mixed-integer programming problems

This package is to develop the typical algorithms for integer programming problems, including the following modules
## Branch and bound
This algorithm is the based on [1]

## Cutting plane
## Strong valid inequalities
## Lagrange duality
## Column generation
## Row generation
## Benders' algorithm
## Primal heuristics
